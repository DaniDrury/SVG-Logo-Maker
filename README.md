## Installation

## Usage
One all dependencies are installed, type 'node index.js' in an integrated terminal. Answer the prompted questions. You may enter color choices by typing the color name or hexidecimal value. Once all questions are answered, your logo.svg file will be created and can be found in the "examples" directory.
